# Trackduino
Integration the Trackduino to Arduino IDE

This library was created as an alternative to the official Trackduino IDE, because the original program consumes a lot of PC hardware and a lot of controller resources. This library presents you with the same functionality, only executed as a library for the Arduino IDE.



### ATTENTION: 
The library gives access to all pins and devices, and does not repeat devices that are connected externally!



### API:

For firmware, use the "Arduino Mega or Mega 2560" board in the Arduino IDE.

For all implemented devices on the board, there are examples available through the standard Arduino IDE (file/example/Trackduino/..) examples.



### Driver:

There is an archive in the repository <driver.zip > if you have any problems identifying the board, install it.



Enjoy using it :)
